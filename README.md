# Tutorial on Action Model Acquisition

To be held at ICAPS 2023, in Prague, Czech Republic.

## Summary

This tutorial covers some of the landmark methods in the area of planning action model acquisition that the planning community has produced over the years. From OBSERVER in the early 90’s to the modern forms of action-label-only LOCM techniques, we cover both the concepts behind these approaches and grounded hands-on examples for attendees to try for themselves.
